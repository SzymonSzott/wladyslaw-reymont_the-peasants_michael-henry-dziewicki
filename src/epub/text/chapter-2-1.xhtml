			<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
			<p>Winter had come.</p>
			<p>In the first days, it was but trying its strength⁠—wrestling with the autumn, and howling far away in the livid distance, like some ravenous monster.</p>
			<p>Now dawned those chilly glacial days, days of dismal and mournful dejection, lit with a dribbling feeble light; corpse-like days, when the birds flew away to the woods with cries of dread, and the waters babbled fearsomely, rolling sluggishly on, as if palsied by the terror of the cold; and the very country-side seemed to shudder, and all that was therein to look in awe towards the north and its unfathomable depths of clouds.</p>
			<p>As yet the nights were as those in autumn, full of dreary sighs and soughs; sounds as of struggling, and sudden hushes; the howl of dogs; the cracking snaps of freezing timber; the sad voices of shelter-seeking birds; horrible calls from weird woodlands and crossways, invisible in the dark; and the beating of eerie wings, and shadows lurking beneath the walls of the stupefied cottagers.</p>
			<p>At evening, from time to time, the huge crimson bulk of the setting sun would still peer out of the west, going down ponderously⁠—a globe of molten iron, whence blood-red floods would gush forth, with smoke-like pitch-black vapours rising round them, looking like a grand and gloomy conflagration.</p>
			<p>They said: “The winter is growing harder, and ill winds will be rising soon.”</p>
			<p>And indeed the winter did grow harder⁠—every day, every hour, every minute.</p>
			<p>Directly after the fourth of December (the day of St. Barbara, patroness of a holy death), the first of the winter gales began blowing in short whiffling puffs. They skimmed along the ground, with a baying like that of hounds hot on a trail. They bit into the ploughed fields, snarled about the bushes, worried the snow-drifts, tore at the orchard boughs, swept along the highways, sniffed in the streams; and here and there, with but little ado, they ruined every thatch and fence that was in poor condition. After which they fled, still baying, away to the forest lands; and after them out of the dusk came the great winds on the very same evening, their long sharp tongues lolling out of their wheezy jaws.</p>
			<p>All night they blew, howling across the fields like packs of famished wolves. They did their work well, too. Ere morning the stark hardened earth had been quite stripped of its tattered and scattered covering of snow; only in places, in hollows and ditches, could a few white rags be seen on the fences. The fields too had some shiny white spots left; but the roads lay frozen deep⁠—as it were, petrified⁠—and the frost had bitten profoundly into the soil with its keen fangs, so that it resounded with a metallic ring like iron. But with the morning, the gales fled to hide in the woods, where they lurked, tremulous and shuddering.</p>
			<p>The sky, too, was now overcast, ever with darker clouds, which came creeping up out of every cavern, raising heads of monstrous size, stretching forth long lean flanks, throwing their grey manes to the winds, baring gigantic discoloured teeth, and coming on in mighty battalions.⁠—From the north: black, huge, all shredded and tattered, piled in tiers, branching out like a score of overthrown forests, one upon the other, separated by deep chasms, and with⁠—so it seemed⁠—great streaks scattered over them of greenish ice, as it were: these rushed forward with wild might and a dull murmuring sound. From the west: those advanced slowly⁠—livid, enormously swollen bulks, which in places shone bright as fire; and they rolled one after another, more and more persistent in their long advance, not unlike flocks of great birds. From the east came sailing flattened, rusty-hued masses of vapour, monotonously the same, and forbidding to the eye as mouldering carcasses that drip with tainted gore. From the south, too, were wafted ancient-looking clouds, reddish dark in hue, recalling clods of peat, striped and motley to see, though dingy and dull, as if vermin burrowed within them. There were also clouds floating on high, seeming to descend from the pale quenched orb of the sun, and forming dingy wisps, or spreading out in manifold tints, as embers that are dying. And they all came forward, built up mountains of prodigious height, and concealed all the sky under a black seething flood of squalor and grime.</p>
			<p>The whole land had suddenly turned to darkness; a dull silence prevailed on every side; all the lights had grown dim; the bright eyes of the waters were glazing over; all beings felt petrified and stood in amazement with bated breath. Up out of the earth surged the fear of what was to come; the frost penetrated even to the marrow of the bones, and every living thing trembled with the terror of it. They saw the hare running through the village, with shaggy fur standing fluffy on end; they saw the ravens alighting with hoarse croaks upon the granaries, and even entering the houses. Dogs howled wildly outside in the yard; men sped in fear to take shelter in their huts: while along the pond the priest’s blind mare went to and fro with the ruins of the cart, and struck against the fences, and with a weird cry sought her way back to the stable.</p>
			<p>The darkness began to be continual, murky and exceedingly depressing; daily the clouds sailed lower; they came creeping down from the forests, like thick volumes of dust, and rolled along the fields like floods of turbid water: then, coming to the village, plunged all things in a dingy ice-cold fog. And suddenly there would come a rent through the midst of the sky that shone dark-blue like the azure mirror of a well: a wild wind whistled through the dim space, the fogs at once were driven together on either side, and by the shattered gateway thus made came a first loud blast, soon followed by another, a score, and hundreds.</p>
			<p>They howled on in troops, they poured forwards in torrents that nothing could restrain; they rushed along as if coming out of broken fetters, in raging bellowing multitudes, striking at the gloom, dispelling it utterly, swallowing it up or sweeping it away like rotten chaff.</p>
			<p>And out and far over the fields, in screaming turmoil, was driven the fog as froth before the wind.</p>
			<p>The clouds, trampled down by the feet of the pitiless storm, fled and rolled off, to skulk in the woodlands and forests. The sky was swept clean; once more, though with dull and sullen mien, the day peered forth, and every creature drew a breath of relief.</p>
			<p>For nearly the whole of Sunday the gales blew on without any surcease or abatement. In the day-time, they were not yet quite intolerable; but the nights became beyond bearing. These fell, bright and starlit, and it was then that the gales played their most furious pranks. Folks did not say (as they do when the wind is high): “Sure someone has hung himself,” but: “Fivescore men must be hanging now!” What with the howling, the banging, and the creaking as of a thousand empty wagons dashing at a gallop over hard-frozen ice, no one could sleep a wink.</p>
			<p>The huts creaked likewise. Often and again did the storm come driving at the corners, heaving up the thatches, butting at the doors: sometimes even breaking in the panes so that they had to get up at night and stop them with pillows: for it then rushed in with a sound like the squealing of noisy swine⁠—bringing along with it such fierce cold as benumbed the inmates under their eiderdown quilts.</p>
			<p>None can say what the villagers suffered, in the course of those days, of those nights.</p>
			<p>Nor what harm was done abroad. The blasts bore down the fences, plucked off the thatched roofs, and⁠—at the Voyt’s⁠—blew down a shed that was all but new. They tore the roof from Bartek Koziol’s granary, and carried it away more than a furlong’s distance into the fields; they threw down the chimney at the Vincioreks’; they wrenched a good bit of boarding from the mill-roof: and as to the multitudes of minor losses, and the many trees uprooted in the orchards and woods, who can tell them? Why, upon the highway alone, they tore up and cast across the road about a score of poplars, that lay like as many murdered and pitilessly mutilated corpses!</p>
			<p>The oldest inhabitant could not remember when the winds had been so hostile and done so much injury.</p>
			<p>Folk therefore kept at home, wrangling together beneath the smoky rafters of their own cabins; for it was no light matter to show one’s nose round the corner. Some of the women, however, being less patient, would at times cautiously step outside their enclosures and visit their gossip-loving neighbours: ostensibly to spin in company, but in reality to whet their tongues and give vent to their ill humour. Meanwhile, the men were threshing stubbornly on behind the closed granary-doors, and from morning till late at night the flails smote upon the floor. The frost had nipped the corn; and so the grain was more readily threshed out.</p>
			<p>These gales brought with them more and more biting frosts. With mighty strokes they had frozen all the brooks and streamlets. The morasses were now solid. Even the mill-pond was coated over with a sheet of bluish transparent ice. Only close to the bridge, where the water grew deeper, was it still in motion: all the rest of its banks were fettered by the ice, and openings had to be cut for drawing water.</p>
			<p>No change of weather came till St. Lucia’s day.</p>
			<p>Then the frost slackened somewhat; the winds paused to take breath: they swept the plain more seldom and with less boisterous fury; the grey sky grew smooth as a well-harrowed field’s vast hempen-coloured surface, and so low that it seemed resting on the poplar tree-tops along the road.</p>
			<p>But presently, after the noonday Angelus, the frost increased a little and the snow fell in large flakes.</p>
			<p>Dusk then came earlier, and the snow still fell thicker and thicker, though drier and more powdery, until the night closed in.</p>
			<p>By morning the snow was three good spans deep; it covered the whole land like a fleece, veiled it under its own white expanse, shaded with bluish tints; and still it continued to fall without intermission.</p>
			<p>And so great a stillness came over the land that no noise, no sound pierced the masses of down, now floating to the ground. All had grown silent, dumb: as though, by some miracle, all things had stopped in awe, listening to the all but inaudible rustle of the falling flakes, so quietly floating earthward⁠—a dim flickering whiteness, unceasingly descending!</p>
			<p>The night was now a whitish obscurity, a glimmering, pearly, immaculate dawn, like the finest bleached wool on earth; this glimmering from out of the infinite abyss⁠—as it were, the frozen shimmer of the light of all stars, condensed and ground to dust in its downward flight from heaven⁠—now besprinkled the whole country; and soon the pine-woods were shrouded, the meadows disappeared, the highways vanished, and all the village was lost in the silvery haze and blinding dust, and nothing more was to be seen but streams of sifted snow, wafted down as still and smooth and soft as cherry-blossoms in a moonlit night!</p>
			<p>At three paces’ distance, there was no making out either huts or trees or fences, or any human face; human voices alone, like butterflies on wearied wings, flitted about in the nebulous whiteness.</p>
			<p>This went on for two whole days and nights. In the end, the cabins were all snowed up, and rose, each like a snow-covered hill, with a long tress of smoke waving from its top. Roads and fields had become one vast plain: the orchards were all filled with snow, even above the tops of the enclosures; the pond had become quite invisible beneath the avalanche and, in place of the ground, there was but a pale, flat, impassable, miraculous plain of down.</p>
			<p>The snow fell still, though now more dry and scantier. At night the stars would twinkle athwart its curtain: by day, at times, the blue sky would show beyond the whirl of floating specks and flitters; voices sounded more sonorous and came no longer muffled through the veil. The village seemed to wake up a little, and folk began to stir themselves. Some even attempted to drive out in sledges, but soon returned, finding the ways impracticable. Here and there, they dug paths through the snow from cabin to cabin; every heart rejoiced. Especially the children were beside themselves with delight; and dogs rushed about everywhere, barking, licking the snow, and scampering with the urchins, who swarmed on to the roadways, clamoured in the enclosures, shouted, pelted one another with snowballs, built horrible monsters, and dragged each other about on toboggans; their joyful cries and merry sports filled all the place with din. Roch had to give up teaching that day, for keeping them in the house over their primers was impossible.</p>
			<p>About the third day, the snow ceased as twilight fell; and though there were still a few flakes, they were like the shakings out of an empty sack of flour⁠—nothing to speak of. But the sky was overcast, crows flapped their wings about the houses and alighted on the roads; the night came down starless and leaden, its obscurity diminished only by the whiteness of the frosty snow⁠—and as still as one shorn of strength to the uttermost.</p>
			<p>“Let but the slightest wind spring up, and we shall have a snowstorm,” muttered old Bylitsa the next morning, as he peeped out at the window.</p>
			<p>Hanka lit the fire on the hearth, and looked into the passage. It was early yet: all over the hamlet, the cocks were crowing. The twilight was still dusky, as if lime and soot had been mingled and spread over the world; but in the east there glowed a heap, as it were, of ash-covered embers.</p>
			<p>The cold in the room was so keen, so damp and bitterly piercing, that Hanka had to put on her clogs in the house over her bare feet. On the hearth, there was scarce any fire at all; the green juniper brushwood only crackled and smoked. Hanka hacked a few chips off a board, poked some straw under them, and at last got the fire to blaze.</p>
			<p>“Enough snow has fallen for a whole winter,” the old man said again, blowing on the window, crusted over with a thick coating of greenish ice.</p>
			<p>The eldest boy, now entering on his fourth year, began crying in bed; and from Staho’s lodgings on the other side of the hut, angry voices, the weeping of children, and the slamming of doors were heard.</p>
			<p>“Oh, Veronka is already at her morning prayers!” Antek remarked satirically, as he wound round his legs the bands he had previously warmed at the fire.</p>
			<p>“Ah, well,” the old man mumbled, “she has learned to talk⁠—and she talks. A little too much perhaps, but she means no harm.”</p>
			<p>“Means no harm! And does she mean no harm when she beats her children? Does she mean no harm when she leads poor Staho a dog’s life, with never a good word for him?” Thus Hanka made reply, as she knelt down by the cradle to suckle her little baby, which was crying and kicking its legs about.</p>
			<p>“Since we came, three Sundays have gone by: not one day has passed without a quarrel and fighting and curses. She a woman? No, she’s a brute.⁠ ⁠… But Staho too is a mollycoddle, who lets her swinge and cuff him at will. He works like a horse, and she treats him worse than a dog.”</p>
			<p>The old man cast a deprecating look at Hanka, and was about to say a word in Veronka’s behalf, when the door opened and Staho himself, flail on shoulder, peeped in.</p>
			<p>“Antek, will you come and thresh? The organist told me to get someone for his barley, which is dry and good, and comes splendidly out of the husk.⁠ ⁠… Philip begged me to take him; but if you will, here’s work for you.”</p>
			<p>“Thanks kindly,” was Antek’s reply; “but I am not going to work at the organist’s. Philip will do very well.”</p>
			<p>“Please yourself. Good day.”</p>
			<p>At her husband’s refusal, Hanka had started up; but she at once bent down, her head over the cradle, to hide the tears that gushed forth.</p>
			<p>“What! in this fearful winter, so poor that we have only a few potatoes and salt, and having not a stiver to bless himself with⁠ ⁠… he refuses work offered! Sits all day long in the hut, smoking cigarettes and brooding!⁠ ⁠… Or else roams and prowls about like one distraught, seeking⁠ ⁠… what? The wind perhaps? O my God, my God!” she sobbed in her distress.⁠ ⁠… “And now, even Yankel will trust us no more: and we shall have to sell the cow.⁠ ⁠… True, it is not beseeming that he should work on another peasant’s land.⁠ ⁠… But what⁠—what can we do?⁠—Lord! were I a man, I would not spare myself nor shirk toil, but work till my arms dropped.⁠ ⁠… Alas! poor thing that I am, what can I do?” And she set about her household duties, now and then casting a furtive glance at Antek, who sat close to the hearth, with his eldest son on his lap, wrapped in his sheepskin, and chafed his little feet with a hand warmed at the fire, but sighed and stared moodily into the blaze the while. The old man was peeling potatoes at the window.</p>
			<p>Silence had arisen between them, disquieting, pregnant with hidden griefs, and heightened by the stifling sensation of misery. They would not look into each other’s eyes, nor talk; their words trailed off into plaints, their smiles faded and went out; in their looks flamed suppressed reproaches; in their pallid emaciated faces harsh feelings were to be read, and their minds burned with bitter resentment. Three weeks had passed since they had been turned from Boryna’s door: so many long days and nights, and they had every detail of the expulsion yet distinct in their memories. The injury was as fresh as ever, the stubborn sense of revolt as strong.</p>
			<p>The fire was now burning merrily, and its warmth spread through the room, till the frost melted on the window-panes, and the snow in the chinks outside the hut trickled down in water, while a little moisture oozed from the hard-beaten floor.</p>
			<p>“Those Jews⁠ ⁠… are they coming?” she asked at length.</p>
			<p>“They said they would.”</p>
			<p>And again not one word more. Indeed, who should speak first? Should Hanka?⁠ ⁠… She, who durst not open her mouth, lest the gall that filled her heart should flow forth in spite of her!⁠—Or Antek? What had he to say? That he was miserable? They both knew that. He never had been prone to make friends; and as to pouring out his heart, even to his own wife, he had no wish to do that! Besides, how could he speak, now that his soul was eaten up with hatred, and every memory made him writhe and clench his fists in such rage that he would willingly have vented it upon the whole village!</p>
			<p>He now treasured no longer the sweet recollection of Yagna, any more than if he had never known her, than if he never had held in his arms the girl whom he now could tear in pieces.</p>
			<p>And yet what he felt was not hatred. “Some women” (thus he thought of her) “are like stray dogs, always ready to follow anyone who offers a bigger morsel, or shakes a stick to be obeyed.” Even these thoughts were not very frequent: in presence of the avalanche of deadly wrongs done him by his father, he forgot hers. The old man was guilty of all: yes, it was his father⁠—the villain, the tyrant, the thorn in his side that ever rankled deeper and more cruelly!⁠—it was through him⁠—through him!⁠—that all had come to pass.</p>
			<p>Every evil inflicted, every suffering that he had undergone in these days, was garnered up in his bosom, and formed a horrible rosary of pangs and tortures; but he incessantly told the beads in his mind, that his memory of them might be fresh.</p>
			<p>Of his poverty he made little account. He was a stalwart fellow: needed but a roof over his head, and no more.</p>
			<p>“Let my wife,” he thought, “see to the children.”⁠—What stung him above all the rest was the utter injustice shown to him. This he felt, continually more inflamed, as the rubbed sting of a nettle. What! In but three weeks, all the hamlet had come to look upon him as though he were an unknown intruder. No one spoke to him, no one looked in at his door, nobody had even a word of kind greeting for him. He felt himself an outlaw.</p>
			<p>Well, if they did not come, he was not the man to beg them. But neither would he hide in a corner⁠—far less yield an inch of the way to any. If they cared to have a fight, why, then, let them have it!⁠ ⁠… But now, why was all this? Because he had fought his father?⁠—Aha! was that unheard of in Lipka? Did not Joseph Vahnik fight his father every other day? Had not Staho Ploshka broken his father’s leg? And yet no one had a word of blame for either! No, it was only he they were shocked at. Of course: “Whom God favours, His saints favour too”; and Boryna was as a god in Lipka!</p>
			<p>All that time, breathing only revenge and the thought of it, he had lived on in a fever of excitement. He did not take to work, lost thought of his poverty, forgot all about the morrow: broken down after the agony gone through, he merely crawled hither and thither⁠—a self-tormentor everywhere. Now and again he would rise in the night, to go about and roam along the roads or crouch hidden in dark corners, dreaming of vengeance, and swearing that he would never forgive.</p>
			<p>They took breakfast together without one word; and he sat with eyes of bewilderment, ruminating the past⁠—thorny bitter provender, hard to chew!</p>
			<p>By now the day was getting on, and the fire had gone out. A cold whitish light from the snows outside shone through the partly thawed panes: the chilly dismal glare lit up every nook and showed the room in all its wretched nakedness.</p>
			<p>Heavens! By the side of such a hut, Boryna’s cabin was a mansion. Nay, any of his father’s outhouses, even the cow-byre, was fitter for human abode. It was a foul sty, not a dwelling-place; a heap of rotted logs, dried dung, worthless rubbish! Not a single board to cover the bare ground, whose clay was honeycombed with holes filled up with frozen mud and sweepings, whence an odour worse than a manure-heap exhaled whenever the fire-place warmed the room. Above this quag of a floor rose the walls, warped and mouldy down which the damp trickled, and in whose dark corners the Frost shook his hoary beard: walls with numberless holes, stopped with clay⁠—or even, in some places, straw and cow-dung. The low ceiling hung down like a torn old sieve; there were fewer boards in it than holes, stopped with bundles of straw. Only the furniture and household utensils, together with the holy images on the walls, to some extent concealed this state of dire destitution; whilst the great press, and the horizontal pole across the room on which the clothes were hung, hid the wickerwork partition that separated the room from the byre.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>Hanka soon got through her work, though she had not to hurry: one cow, a heifer, a young pig and a few geese and fowls forming all her live stock, and indeed all her wealth. She dressed the boys, who presently went out into the passage to play with Veronka’s children; the sound of their frolics was soon heard. Then she tidied herself up a little, as she expected the dealers, and would have to go to the village afterwards.</p>
			<p>She particularly wished to talk the matter of the sale over with Antek beforehand; but she could not venture to speak first. He, still sitting by the fire that burned no more, was staring into the distance with a mien so sombre that it made her afraid.</p>
			<p>What could it be that ailed him?</p>
			<p>She took off her clogs, lest their clatter might annoy him, and cast in his direction more and more frequent glances full of affectionate disquietude.</p>
			<p>“Ah,” she thought, “it is harder, far harder for him than for other men!” and a great desire came over her to question him, to try and guess his sorrows, and mourn over them with him. Already she was standing by his side, ready with words of kindness, welling up from her loving heart. But then, how could she speak to him, if he paid no more heed to her than if she were not there? She heaved a sigh, for her heart was very heavy. Good God! how much better off so many another woman was⁠—even though without a roof she could call her own! Should he raise his voice⁠—nay, even his hand⁠—against her, well, she would at least know she had a living man by her side, and not a log of wood. “But he!⁠ ⁠… Not a word! Now and then he growls, as an angry dog would⁠—or looks at me so that my blood runs cold. I cannot talk with him, nor open my heart in converse with him at all. A wife⁠—what is that to him? A pair of hands to tidy the cabin⁠—to cook his food⁠—to nurse his children! Does he care for me in any wise? ever caress me, pet me, treat me tenderly, or even chat with me? All that has no interest for him: he keeps his mind aloof from all around him, makes himself as a stranger, and succeeds so well that he sees nothing that goes on. Yes, let the poor wife bear every burden on her own shoulders: suffer alone⁠—come and go⁠—trouble about all things: he will never pay her with one gracious word!”</p>
			<p>She could no longer keep back her tears, the bitter overflow of her grief, and went out to the byre beyond the partition wall, where, leaning against the manger, she wept in silence; but when the cow Krasula, with a deep breath, set to licking her head and shoulders, she burst out into loud lamentations.</p>
			<p>“And I shall lose you too, my poor beast!⁠ ⁠… They will come.⁠ ⁠… They are coming.⁠ ⁠… They will bargain for you⁠ ⁠… and then throw a rope round your horns⁠ ⁠… and lead you off, you that give us our food!” she murmured low, putting her arm round its neck, and turning with all the affection of her wounded heart towards this creature that felt for her.⁠—No, this could go on no longer.⁠—The cow was to be sold; then there would be nothing for them to eat!⁠ ⁠… And he refused to seek work! Had they not asked him to thresh? and he would not go. He might have earned one <i>zloty</i> ten kopeks daily.⁠ ⁠… That would have at least bought salt, and a little lard to make up for the milk that was to fail them now.</p>
			<p>She returned to the dwelling-room, ready to speak her mind.</p>
			<p>“Antek!” she cried, in a hard, determined voice.</p>
			<p>Silently he raised his bloodshot eyes to hers, with a gaze of such immense anguish and sorrow that she was overwhelmed with dread, while her heart thrilled with compassion.</p>
			<p>“Did you say they had come for the cow?”</p>
			<p>“They are surely on the way; dogs are barking down there.”</p>
			<p>“No, that is in Sikora’s enclosure,” she said after having gone out to look.</p>
			<p>“They promised to come in the forenoon, and we have only to wait.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, <i>must</i> we sell?”</p>
			<p>“Alas! we want money, and our pasture-land is not enough for Krasula and the heifer too.⁠—Yes, we must, Hanka; what’s to be done? I am sorry to lose the cow,” he went on in a low voice, and with such sweetness of tone that Hanka felt spellbound, while her heart went pit-a-pat with great joy and hope: at that moment, she cared neither for the loss of the cow, nor any of their other misfortunes. And she gazed earnestly into his beloved face, listening to that voice of his which entered into her like a flame, and kindled such delightful feelings within her.</p>
			<p>“Ah, yes, we must. Well, the heifer remains to us. She will calve about Mid-Lent, and so we shall have a little milk then,” she chimed in, wishing only to hear him speak further.</p>
			<p>“And if we should lack provender, we’ll buy some.”</p>
			<p>“Oat-straw perhaps: our rye will last till spring.⁠—Father, pray open our potato-pit: we must see if the potatoes we have are not frost-nipped.”</p>
			<p>“Father, stay where you are, the work is too hard for you: I’ll do it.”</p>
			<p>He rose, took his sheepskin down from the pole, and went outside.</p>
			<p>The snow was almost as high as the roof, for the cabin stood in an open place, almost out of the village, a field’s length from the road, and with neither hedgerow nor orchard to keep the snow away. Several wild gnarled cherry-trees grew in front of the windows, but they were so buried in the drift that their branches alone stood protruding like human fingers twisted and bent by some disease.⁠—Earlier in the day, the old man had already cleared away the snow in front of the cabin, but he had at the same time covered the mound<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-21" id="noteref-21" epub:type="noteref">21</a> so deep that it was impossible to distinguish it in the snow.⁠—Antek set vigorously to work: the snow stood as high as a man, and⁠—though lately fallen⁠—it had caked together and hardened so much that it had to be cut out in lumps; and he sweated enough ere the potato-pit was dug open. But he worked willingly, now and then throwing a few flitters at the children, who were playing outside the threshold. At times, however, he would pause in his work to lean back against the cabin-wall and look around. Then he would heave a profound sigh, and his soul would once more go astray like a sheep lost in the shadows of the night. The sky was all covered with a whitish cloud, which hung at no great height. The snows lay extended like a huge soft fleece, forming, as far as the eye could reach, an immense plain, white with a tinge of blue; the air, misty with suspended crystals of frost, seemed to wrap the whole world in a delicate pellucid tissue. As Bylitsa’s hut was on rising ground, one saw thence the whole village spread out in a bird’s-eye view: those lines of snow-clad mounds, like huge molehills, straggling away in long strings round the pond, none completely bare, but all hid by the white sheet spread over them. Here and there a granary wall stood out, darkly prominent; ruddy-brown coils of curling peat-smoke went up; or a few trees peered out, grey beneath the dazzling mantle in which they were enveloped; and athwart this world all of silver tinges, voices travelled swift and sharp, heard together with the flails’ monotonous <i>rutta-rutta-rutta</i>, drumming underground, as it were. The ways were all snowed up; no one fared along them, nor did any living thing darken the silvery expanse of the fields. The hazy distances melted into one another, so that sky and earth were undistinguishable, save where the forest made a faint blue stain on the white, as if some cloud were hanging at the horizon.</p>
			<p>Antek’s gaze wandered but for a little while over those snowy wastes; it presently returned and sought his father’s cabin; and in the search his attention was diverted by a cry from Hanka, who had gone down into the potato-pit.</p>
			<p>“Ha! they are not frozen! Vahnik’s store has been so frost-bitten that half must be given to the swine to eat; and ours⁠—ours is quite untouched!”</p>
			<p>“That is good news.⁠—Pray go out and see, for if I mistake not, the Jews are coming at last, and we must take the cow out of the byre.”</p>
			<p>“You are right: it is the Jews⁠—who but they? Yes, it is.⁠—Poisonous creatures!” she exclaimed with abhorrence.</p>
			<p>Along a pathway just visible by the marks of Staho’s boots, made when he went out in the morning, there came two Jews from the tavern, heavily plodding along, followed by half the dogs in the village (that greatly enjoyed this opportunity to bark at them) until Antek arrived and drove them away.</p>
			<p>“Oh, how do you do?⁠—We come late, on account of the snow.⁠—Such drifts!⁠—No driving through them, no getting through on foot even, I tell you. They have had to employ forced labour to make the road passable through the forest.”</p>
			<p>To these attempts at conversation he replied nothing, but made them enter his hut to warm themselves a little.</p>
			<p>Hanka, having cleaned the cow’s soiled flanks and milked away what had gathered since the morning, brought her through the room into the yard. The cow made resistance, unwilling to go out; on passing the threshold, she sniffed, stretched her head forth into the air, licked the snow, and on a sudden burst into long plaintive lowing, pulling so hard at the rope that old Bylica could scarcely hold her.</p>
			<p>Hanka broke down. Seized with an unbearable pang, she burst out crying, as did the children too, holding to their mother’s skirt.</p>
			<p>Nor was Antek in much better mood. He ground his teeth, leaned back against the cabin wall, and stared doggedly at a lot of crows that had assembled on the snow dug from the pit. The dealers meanwhile jabbered in Yiddish to each other, and proceeded to feel the cow and examine her critically.</p>
			<p>The whole family, sick at heart, turned away in deep dejection from the beast tugging at her halter and vainly looking to her masters with great frightened eyes, and lowing in vain.</p>
			<p>“O Lord!⁠—Was it for this, Krasula, that I fed you so well, and cared for all your wants, that these men should now take you to the slaughter-house, and destroy you!” And in agony she struck the cabin wall with her head.</p>
			<p>Alas! Wailing and lamenting were of no avail; for “What needs must be⁠—no man can flee,” as the saying is.</p>
			<p>“How much?” the elder of the couple, a grey-bearded Jew, asked at last.</p>
			<p>“Three hundred <i>zloty</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-22" id="noteref-22" epub:type="noteref">22</a></p>
			<p>“What! for that scraggy brute⁠—three hundred?⁠—Anthony, is aught the matter with you?”</p>
			<p>“Scraggy? Say ye no such word, or ye shall rue it! Scraggy! Look but at her⁠—so young⁠—scarce in her fifth year⁠—and in such goodly condition!” So spoke Hanka, enraged.</p>
			<p>“Pshaw! Pshaw! Who doth business, a word shall not anger him.⁠—Say thirty roubles!”</p>
			<p>“I have spoken.”</p>
			<p>“And I shall speak. Thirty-one?⁠ ⁠… Well, thirty-one and a half.⁠—Thirty-two?⁠—Then let it be thirty-two and a half.⁠ ⁠… It’s a bargain?”</p>
			<p>“I have said.”</p>
			<p>“My last word: three and thirty!”⁠—“Take it or leave it,” added the younger Jew phlegmatically, looking round for his staff, while the elder buttoned up his gaberdine.</p>
			<p>Thereupon Bylitsa said, patting the cow’s neck: “For such a beast as this!⁠—O men, fear ye not God? A cow as large as a byre!⁠—Why, her hide alone will be worth half a score of roubles⁠—O ye swindlers! ye murderers of Christ!”</p>
			<p>But now the Jews began to chaffer eagerly, violently. Antek stood stubbornly to his price; and though he gave way a little, it was but little. Indeed, the cow Krasula was very valuable; and had he been selling it in spring and to another peasant, he would have got fifty roubles at least. But “Necessity drives to the mart, with Poverty drawing the cart.” This the Jews were perfectly aware of; and though they shouted louder and louder, and struck their hands in Antek’s with greater zeal to conclude the bargain, their offers rose by at most half a rouble each time.</p>
			<p>Finally it came to this pass, that they started home in high dudgeon, and Hanka was leading the cow back to her shed, while Antek himself was angered and ready to renounce selling the beast at all⁠—when lo! back they came again, and shrieked and swore that they could not possibly offer a higher price, and struck their hands in Antek’s again⁠ ⁠… till at last the man agreed to forty roubles, plus two <i>zloty</i> for old Bylica, as the holder of the rope.</p>
			<p>They paid on the nail; the old man led the cow after them to the tavern where their sledge was waiting. Accompanied by the children, Hanka went with Krasula as far as the road, stroking her muzzle every now and then, affectionately bending over her, and quite unable to conceal her grief and affliction.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>She stood long upon the road, looking at Krasula as she was led away, and pouring out execrations on those unchristened “Yellow Ones.”</p>
			<p>To lose such a cow as Krasula was!⁠—No wonder if the poor woman felt her bosom overflow with gall!</p>
			<p>When she came back, she said: “It is as if one of us had been borne to the churchyard”; and she still continued to peep into the empty stall, or to gaze through the window at the pathway marked by the hoofs which had but now passed there; and often and often did she give way to her distress, and shed tears again and again.</p>
			<p>“Now then, will you have done?” Antek cried out, seating himself at the table where the money lay. “Why, the woman is for all the world like a calf; doth naught but weep and blubber.”</p>
			<p>“ ‘He that suffereth naught will for nothing have thought,’ ” was Hanka’s reply. “You suffered nothing, when you gave poor Krasula up to those Jews to be butchered.”</p>
			<p>“Aye, you’d rather have me open my own bowels to get you money!”</p>
			<p>“And now we remain like the very last of hired servants⁠—like <i>Dziads</i>⁠—without one drop of milk, without one crumb of comfort! This⁠—this is what my share of my own house and home have earned for me.⁠—Merciful heavens! Other men work as hard as oxen, and bring something home; and this man sells the very last thing⁠—the cow, my marriage portion, all I had from my family!” she went on in uncontrollable excitement.</p>
			<p>“Being a fool and without understanding, you may bellow at your ease.⁠—Here’s money for you. Pay what you owe, buy what you need, keep the rest.” He pushed the roubles over to her, but, taking five from the heap, put them into his pocket-book.</p>
			<p>“And why take so much money with you?”</p>
			<p>“Why? I am not going to start off with nothing but my staff.”</p>
			<p>“Start off? and whither?”</p>
			<p>“Anywhither, if it be but away from here. I will seek work, and not rot here in Lipka.”</p>
			<p>“<i>Away?</i> A dog is barefoot everywhere⁠—‘Where’er the poor man goes, the wind against him blows.’⁠—Ah! and I am to stay here alone, say? Am I?” And, raising her voice, she approached him with a threatening mien, not knowing what she did; he meanwhile took no notice of her, occupied as he was in taking down his sheepskin, putting his girdle on, and looking for his cap.</p>
			<p>“Work for the peasants here? That I will not,” he declared. “No: though I should starve; I will not!”</p>
			<p>“The organist is in want of a thresher.”</p>
			<p>“That great man!⁠—A calf who bleats in the choir, and is good for naught else; whose eyes are always on the farmers’ money-bags, and who lives on what he gets out of them by begging or by lying!”</p>
			<p>“ ‘Who has no goodwill shirks his duty still!’ ”</p>
			<p>“Enough! You’re saucy!” he cried out in anger.</p>
			<p>“When do I say a word to oppose you? You always do as you please, and I am nowhere!”</p>
			<p>“I shall apply at the manors,” he said presently, in a gentler tone. “I mean to inquire about service to be had, and perhaps may get something by Christmas. But I would rather be a common ploughman elsewhere than rot here, where the wrong done me stares me in the face at every step. That I cannot bear. I have enough of it⁠—enough of being pitied by some, and looked upon by others as a mangy dog!” As he spoke, he waxed angrier and more highly wrought and Hanka, seized with terror, stood petrified and motionless: she had never yet seen him in such a state.</p>
			<p>“Farewell. I shall return in a few days.”</p>
			<p>“Antek!”⁠—The word was a despairing scream.</p>
			<p>“What would you?” He turned upon the threshold.</p>
			<p>“Do you grudge me even a friendly parting word?”</p>
			<p>“Is it caresses you mean? Oh, I am in no mood for them just now.” And he went out, slamming the door.</p>
			<p>Uttering a hissing sound between his shut teeth, he walked on quickly through the snow with his staff. The crisp surface crunched underfoot. He looked round at the cabin. Hanka stood against the wall, dissolved in tears; through the other window, Veronka was watching them.</p>
			<p>“Good for nothing in the world but weep, weep, weep again!⁠—Now, forwards and away!” he said, with a glance that swept the snowy wilderness round him. Seized with a strange longing, he felt himself urged on, rejoicing in the thought of unknown hamlets and a new life in a fresh world. The feeling came upon him unexpectedly, and bore him away, as a suddenly swollen torrent carries with it a weakly-rotted shrub, that can neither make head against it nor remain motionless.</p>
			<p>An hour before, so far from making up his mind to go, he had never so much as entertained the thought. Ah! but now he would fly⁠—fly away like a bird, go anywhither⁠—to the forests, aye, and to the undreamed regions beyond them. Truly, why should he stay here to waste his life? what had he to expect here? The memories of the past had eaten him up, dried his heart: for what reason, then, should he cleave to them?⁠—The priest was a good man, and had pointed out clearly to him that he stood no chance in an action against his father, which would besides be costly.⁠—Vengeance?⁠—That might wait till the right time: no man had ever yet wronged him with impunity. So now⁠ ⁠… let him go on⁠—straight before him, no matter whither, if far enough from Lipka!</p>
			<p>But whither first of all?</p>
			<p>He now stood at a bend of the poplar road, gazing, not without some hesitation, over the fields which faded in the misty remoteness. “I shall go through the village and along the road beyond the mill.” And he at once started that way.</p>
			<p>Half a field’s length before striking off the road, he had to turn aside; for under the poplars and down the middle of the way a sledge was rushing straight in his direction, with a cloud of snow-dust and a sharp jingling of bells.</p>
			<p>It was Boryna, driving with Yagna. The horses tore along with lusty hoofs, the body of the sledge tossed like a feather behind them. The old man whipped them besides to make them go faster, and urged them on. He was speaking some words, too, and laughing! Yagna was talking in a loud voice, when she suddenly beheld Antek. Each for an instant looked into the other’s eyes⁠—and then had gone past. The sledge flashed by, and was engulfed in the snowstorm it had made; Antek stood in the same spot, looking round at them, and motionless. Now and again they appeared out of the cloud of snow-dust; Yagna’s dress fluttered red in the wind; now the bells would tinkle louder, and again fainter, inaudible, lost somewhere on that vast white plain, beneath the arch of frosted boughs and between the colonnade of dark trunks that sustained them.⁠ ⁠… These stood, as it were, drooping in a row, in their long and weary uphill procession towards the forest. But Antek was always aware of her eyes. They floated before him; they appeared, in the midst of the snow⁠—everywhere⁠—with that look of terror and of sadness; dreamy and pleased at once; keen of glance and laden with the hot fire of life!</p>
			<p>He felt his soul extinguished, so to speak, veiled in a mist, frosted over and chilled to the core: but the deep-blue eyes were shining bright within him. Hanging his head, he dragged himself on with slow steps. More than once he glanced round, but nothing was visible beneath the poplar colonnade, save the blur of a snowy whirlwind fleeing away with a tinkling of far-off bells.</p>
			<p>Oblivion of all things came over him, as though he had lost his memory by some strange happening. He stared helplessly, not knowing what to do⁠ ⁠… or where to go⁠ ⁠… or what had come to pass. He was as one in a dream⁠—a waking dream, which he cannot shake off.</p>
			<p>Almost unconsciously, he got to the tavern, passing several sledges full of folk, amongst whom he recognized no one, though he looked carefully.</p>
			<p>“Where is that crowd of people bound for?” he asked Yankel, who was standing in the doorway.</p>
			<p>“For the court. There’s a lawsuit with the Manor about a cow, and herdsmen assaulted: you know the affair. Those are the witnesses; Boryna started before.”</p>
			<p>“Will they win?”</p>
			<p>“Why should anyone lose? The complaint is against the Squire of Vola, and the Squire of Rudka is to be judge. Why should a Squire lose?⁠—Besides, the folk will have an excursion, will improve the roads, will enjoy themselves; and the townsmen too need to do some business. So everybody will gain a little.”</p>
			<p>Antek was not listening to Yankel’s mockery. He ordered some strong vodka and, leaning against the bar, stood musing there for a full hour, without even tasting the liquor.</p>
			<p>“Is anything ailing you?”</p>
			<p>“What should ail me?⁠—Let me into the private bar.”</p>
			<p>“Impossible. Dealers are there⁠—great merchants, who have purchased another clearing from the Squire; that in Vilche Doly. They must have rest; nay, it may be they are sleeping now.”</p>
			<p>“I’ll pull the scurvy rascals out by their beards!” Antek cried, and rushed madly to the private bar; but ere he got there, he changed his mind, and took his bottle to the darkest nook in the room.</p>
			<p>The tavern was empty and still, save for the Jews talking together in their jargon, Yankel running to serve them, or someone coming in to order a glass, toss it off, and withdraw.</p>
			<p>It was now past noon, and the frost no doubt increasing; for the sledge-runners creaked in the snow, and the tavern grew colder. But Antek remained in a brown study, unable to make out what was going on within him and around.</p>
			<p>He took a dram, then another; but those eyes! They were always with him⁠—dark-blue, turquoise-blue!⁠—and so very near that his eyelids all but touched them.⁠—A third dram, and they grew brighter still, and seemed to whirl about, as lights borne from one part of the room to another!⁠—A cold shudder went through him; terrified, he started to his feet.</p>
			<p>“Pay up, you!” shouted Yankel, blocking the way out. “Pay up! I give you naught on trust.”</p>
			<p>“Out of my way, you dog’s-blood Jew, or I kill you!” Antek shrieked, with such furious violence that Yankel changed colour and shrank away to let him pass.</p>
			<p>He banged the door and rushed out.</p>
